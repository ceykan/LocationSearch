Hello,

I want to describe  what I did a few. 
First of all, I used .Net5 framework , NUnit for the test framework and JetBrains as a compiler.
I have decided to create a library which we will be able to fill in with the necessary functions for the team's needs, or the API's or the web apps' needs. 
It is easy to integrate ,no need to call any endpoints, can be used as a integration point which you can easily add as a project or with just .dll, up to needs. 
This library makes us to do CRUD operations of the lists which we need to use such as list of locations. We may name this library "search", and we can enlarge 
this library with adding new CRUD operations for example for the list of customers. I wanted to do only the most necessary function which you want to see most, 
I believe that , this pattern will show , the design of what I thought for all CRUD operations.
